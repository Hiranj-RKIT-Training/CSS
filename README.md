# **Introduction of Bootstrap**
Bootstrap is a powerful front-end framework used to create modern websites and web apps. It is an open-source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing developers to build responsive, mobile-first projects quickly and efficiently. With a wide array of components and utilities, Bootstrap simplifies the design process.
# **Use of Bootstrap**
Bootstrap is used for:

1\. Developing responsive websites that adjust smoothly to different screen sizes.

2\. Using ready-made components like buttons, forms, modals, navbars, etc., to reduce development time.

3\. Customizing and scaling websites efficiently with a grid system and pre-defined classes.

4\. Creating cross-browser compatible websites by using a consistent framework.
# **Structure of Bootstrap**
Bootstrap consists of the following main components:

1\. CSS: Predefined styles for layout, typography, buttons, forms, and more.

2\. JavaScript: Interactive components like carousels, modals, dropdowns, and tooltips.

3\. Grid System: A flexible and responsive grid system that adjusts the layout based on screen size.

4\. Components: Ready-to-use components like navbars, buttons, cards, and forms.
# **Examples of Bootstrap Usage**
## **Example 1: Basic Layout**

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6">Column 1</div>
            <div class="col-md-6">Column 2</div>
        </div>
    </div>
```
